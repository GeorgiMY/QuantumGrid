If you haven't downloaded a server, first follow these instructions - [Download Server](https://www.quantumgrid.info/docs/configure-server/download-server)

After downloding the server:
1. Start the Quantum Grid software.
1. Click the **"Configure Server"** tab.
1. Click on the Server Placement button.
1. Select the folder where you unzipped the server.
1. Click on the **"Configure Server"** button.

There are 3 important settings you need to change to make your server distribute data from MongoDB:
1. **"Type of data distributed"** should be set to MongoDB.
2. **"MongoDB Collection Name"** should be set to the name of the collection you want to extract data from.

Setting Type of data distributed to MongoDB makes the **"MONGODB_URI"** option pop up at the bottom of the page.

3. **"MONGODB_URI"** should be set to your MongoDB connection string.

Here's a link to an article if you don't know how to find your MongoDB uri - [Find Your Connection String](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/)

**That's it!** Your server can now distribute data from MongoDB! You can tweak the rest of your settings however you'd like!
